            I am a software developer who through self-motivation and hard work
            has learnt to code whilst working full time. I am competent in
            several coding languages including React and JavaScript, and am
            continuing to further my learning. I have proven my skills through
            developing projects such as a React weather app which you can find
            linked below. Currently Iâ€™m seeking a long-term position where I can
            utilise my transferable skills such as problem solving and data
            analysis; and increase my knowledge.
