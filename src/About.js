            I am a front-end developer who through self-motivation and hard work
            has learnt to code whilst working full time. I am competent in
            several coding languages including React and JavaScript and eager to
            learn more. I have proven my skills through developing projects such
            as React weather and dictionary apps which you can find linked
            below. Currently Iâ€™m seeking a long-term position where I can
            utilise my transferable skills such as problem solving and data
            analysis; and increase my knowledge.
