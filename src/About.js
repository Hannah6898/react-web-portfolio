          <p>
            I am a web developer who started their coding journey last year due
            to my love for learning new skills. <br />
            I have a strong knowledge of front-end languages including React,
            CSS and JavaScript. I also have multiple projects to display my
            knowledge. You can check out my projects above! <br />
            I am also eager to expand my knowledge with learning more languages
            including TypeScript, JQuery and Node.js. <br />
            So far learning to code has been challenging but also the most
            rewarding experience and I hope to use the skills I've learnt to
            create projects that add value to people's lives.
