            I’m Hannah, a Software Developer based in Kent currently looking for
            my first junior role. <br />
            I began learning to code at the beginning of this year and found the
            process of learning new technologies and creating solutions to
            difficult problems both exciting and rewarding. <br />
            I have specialised thus far in front end technologies like React and
            am eager to deepen my expertise in this area; with my evenings
            currently spent deepening my JavaScript knowledge and creating React
            projects. <br />
            My long term goal is be able to efficiently turn great ideas into
            functioning products thorough absorbing as much as I can from those
            my senior to become the best developer I can be. <br />
            In my spare time I like to roller skate, watch TV and movies, and
            I’m currently getting into Formula 1.
